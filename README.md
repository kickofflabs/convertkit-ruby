# Convertkit Ruby Client

A Ruby toolkit for [Convertkit](https://convertkit.com/) API.

## Installation

```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

```ruby
require "dotenv"
Dotenv.load(".env.local")

```

## Usage

Calls for Convertkit API v3 are relative to the url [http://api.convertkit.com/v3](http://api.convertkit.com/v3).

API actions are available as methods on the client object. Currently, the Convertkit client has the following methods:

| Action                  | Method                       |
|:------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| List subscribers        | `#subscribers(options = {})` |
| Fetch a subscriber      | `#subscriber(subscriber_id)` |
| List sequences/courses  | `#sequences`                 |
| Add subscriber to sequence | `#add_subscriber_to_sequence(sequence_id, email, options = {})`|
| List tags               | `#tags`                      |
| Add subscriber to tag   | `#add_subscriber_to_tag(tag_id, email, options = {})`|
| List forms              | `#forms`                     |
| Add subscriber to form  | `#add_subscriber_to_form(form_id, email, options = {})`|

**Note:** We do not have complete API coverage yet. If we are missing an API method that you need to use in your application, please file an issue and/or open a pull request. [See the official API documentation](http://kb.convertkit.com/article/api-documentation-v3/) for a complete API reference.

## Use Cases

Here are some common use cases for the Convertkit v3 API client.

First configure the ``convertkit-ruby`` gem with your ``API_KEY`` and ``API_SECRET``, and initialize a new client. After that, you can fetch data from your account.

### List subscribers

List all subscribers added to your account on or after a specific date.

```ruby
response = client.subscribers(from: "2016-03-01")
# => <Faraday::Response ...>

response.status
# => 200
```

### Fetching subscriber data

Subscribers can be looked up by their ``subscriber_id``.

```ruby
response = client.subscriber("17682009")
# => <Faraday::Response ...>

response.status
# => 200
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, copy `.env.local.sample` to `.env.local` and substitute your own real values from your account. Finally, run `rake spec` to run the tests.

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
